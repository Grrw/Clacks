# Clacks
## Overview
This project is inspired by Terry Pratchett's _Going Postal_.
I loved the Semaphore Tower-like Clacks system in the book, and wanted to recreate it.

After seeing the [Clacks GIF maker](http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com/genclacks.php)
on [GNUTerryPratchett](http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com), I wanted to recreated that same idea,
but instead of the 2 by 3 Clacks used in the Clacks board game, with a 4 by 4 like the
representation in the Going Postal movie.

### To do
- [X] Take text and return Clacks
- [x] Take Clacks (formatted or not) and return text
- [ ] Take .txt of one and return .txt of the other
- [ ] Add option to make a Clacks GIF
    - [ ] 1. Make Clacks output into images
    - [ ] 2. Find a way to make images into a GIF
- [ ] Create simple GUI (?)

## The Goal
By the time the project is finished, the program will be able to take a txt file of ascii characters
(most likely with a reasonable character limit) and return a txt file of Clacks, and vice versa.
It will also be able to generate a GIF representation of a given txt file of Clacks or characters.
I do not intend to convert from GIF back to CLacks or text, and am currently unsure whether or not
I'll make a simple GUI for it all.
